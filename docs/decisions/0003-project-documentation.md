# Keeping project documentation alongside code

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to keep our project documentation up to date and easily accessible for everyone involved in the project.
We want to make sure that the documentation is versioned.

## Considered Options

* Keep documentation in the same repository as the code
* Keep documentation in a separate repository

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Keep documentation in the same repository as the code", because it is easier to keep the documentation up to date.
