# Choosing project architecture style

## Context and Problem Statement

To move forward we need to decide on the architecture style for our educational project.

## Considered Options

* Monolith
* Modular Monolith
* Microservices

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Modular Monolith", because it allows us to have an example of a clear separation of concerns which is the goal of this educational project.
Also it is a good starting point for a project that may grow into a microservices architecture in the future.
