### 1.1 Purpose of this Repository

This is a list of the main goals of this repository:

- Get experience of implementing a monolith in a modular way in Go
- Applying software engineering *best practices* (Clean Architecture, Design Patterns, Testable Design etc)
- Keeping design artifacts alongside with the source code: **C4 Model**, **OpenAPI spec**, **ADR**

## 2. How to Run

```bash
make run
```

### 2.2 Make binary

```bash
make build
```

### 2.3 Build Docker image
